# About BlocksMc Config:
Speed
- Use Bhop mode or BlocksMc mode for bypassing. Both are effective.
  
Scaffold
- Ensure the "Verus Fix Packet" option is checked to avoid getting banned.
- If using KeepY Scaffold and experiencing lag back, uncheck the "AutoJump" option to fix it.

KillAura
If you get kicked frequently by the server, try the following adjustments:
- Set Autoblock to either "None" or "Fake".
- Uncheck the "KeepSprint" option.
For safer play, aim for 8–12 CPS.
If KillAura isn’t targeting players, disable AntiBot.
